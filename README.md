# Coding Examples

This is a Sourcegraph extension that provides canonical examples of class and function usage in a Hover provider.

It currently only works for Go code, but can be extended to other languages.

This extension needs access to a Go examples provider.  One option is to run [mhewett/go-example-server](https://github.com/mhewett/go-example-server) on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Sourcegraph extensions are written in TypeScript and are distributed as bundled JavaScript files that run on the client. For creation, publishing, and viewing, you need:

- **Creation**: Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
- **Publishing**: Install the [Sourcegraph CLI (`src`)](https://github.com/sourcegraph/src-cli#installation) and create a [Sourcegraph.com account](https://sourcegraph.com/sign-up).
- **Viewing**: Install the Sourcegraph extension for [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sourcegraph/dgjhfomjieaadpoljlnidmbgkdffpack) or [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sourcegraph/).

## Set up
